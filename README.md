esp8266-Websocket
=================

Testing a Websocket... 

For now not working and @ arduino

I used some code from this lib:
https://github.com/ejeklint/ArduinoWebsocketServer

My ESP8266 is @ 38400 (Arduino pro mini @ 3.3V Its the max speed)

Websocket handshake (working)

Testing websocket online:

My goal is to make it also make it working @  ESP8266.

This is a nice topic, about websocket:
